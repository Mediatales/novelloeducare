          <li><strong>Program Availability</strong>: Ensure your preferred course or specialization is offered with the right curriculum and opportunities.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost of Education</strong>: Consider tuition fees along with living expenses. Countries like Germany and Norway offer low or no tuition fees, while others like the US might be more expensive but offer substantial scholarships.</li>
